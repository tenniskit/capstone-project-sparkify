## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Given that I were Data Scientist working for an online music streaming company called "Sparkify". Users' subscriptions on Sparkify are either Free-tier or Subscription. Both of types of users can cancel the subscription anytime. Cancelling subscription is called 'churn'. The project aims at building a model with Logistics Regression algorithm, trying to predict which users are likely to churn based on their behaviour on Sparkify.
